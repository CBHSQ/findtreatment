              People from all backgrounds experience addiction. Addiction
              doesn't care how old you are, how much money you make, or the
              color of your skin - it has no bias. While the initial choice to
              use a drug is often voluntary, the powerful effects of addiction
              makes it very hard to stop, even if someone wants to.
            </p>
            <p>
              When drugs or alcohol are used so often that they have significant
              negative effects on your life, making it unlivable to the quality
              it was before, this is called a{' '}

            </p>
            <p>
              It causes intense cravings for alcohol or drugs, and can include:
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Using illegal drugs like heroin or cocaine, or excessive
                  alcohol drinking.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Using prescription drugs in ways other than prescribed, or

              Addiction is a chronic and treatable disease. Repeated drug use
              changes the brain, including the parts that help exert
              self-control. That’s why even if someone feels ready to stop using
              drugs, or knows the drug is causing harm, they may not be able to.
            </p>
            <p>
              Some common behaviors of addiction and substance use disorder

              <ol>
                <li>
                  Trying to stop or cut down on drug use, but not being able to.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Using drugs because of being angry or upset with other people
                </li>
                <li>Taking one drug to get over the effects of another.</li>

                  Making mistakes at school or on the job because of using
                  drugs.
                </li>
                <li>Drug use hurting relationships with family and friends.</li>
                <li>Being scared at the thought of running out of drugs.</li>

              It takes courage to seek help for a drug problem. But remember:
              treatment works, there are many paths to help, and people recover

              Like other chronic diseases, addiction can be managed
              successfully. It can take several attempts at treatment to find
              the right approach. Treatment helps people disrupt addiction's
              powerful effects on the brain and behavior and regain control of
              their lives.

              Many treatment professionals consider substance use disorders
              family diseases. To help everyone recover and cope, family may be
              asked to take part in treatment. This may involve going to a

              You can ask questions too - it’s important to make sure the
              services and facility are a good fit for you.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>This is a confidential call</strong>. Answering the

              enforcement for talking about using illegal drugs.

              sign of quality care is being able to be seen quickly. Many

              detox) uses medication to help people withdraw from alcohol or
              drugs after using large amounts. Sometimes, withdrawal can be so
              severe that people hallucinate, have convulsions, or develop other
              dangerous conditions.
            </p>
            <p>
              Detox can take place on a regular medical ward of a hospital, in a
              specialized inpatient detoxification unit, or on an outpatient
              basis with close medical supervision. Detoxification may take
              several days to a week or more.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Social detoxification</strong> can provide the support and
              care for someone who doesn’t need to be medically supervised
              during withdrawal. Sometimes social detoxification centers are
              part of a residential treatment program; other times they are
              separate facilities.
            </p>
            <p>
              Social detoxification centers are not hospitals and seldom use
              medication, but the person does stay there from several days to 1
              week. A staff of nurses watches each person’s medical condition
              closely, and counselors are available to help them through the
              most difficult parts of withdrawing from alcohol and drugs.

              Care frequency depends on the program, with some requiring daily

          <>
            <p>
              Although no single recovery pathway is right for everyone, people
              who are addicted to opioids are usually more successful with
              <strong> medication-assisted treatment (MAT)</strong>. This
              treatment uses FDA-approved medication together with counseling
              and behavioral therapies.
            </p>
            <p>
              Three FDA-approved medications are used in the US to treat opioid
              addiction: methadone, buprenorphine, and naltrexone.
            </p>
            <h3>
              <strong>Methadone</strong>
            </h3>
            <h4>
              <em>(METH-ah-dohn)</em>
            </h4>
            <p>
              Methadone is a long-acting medication that reduces cravings and
              withdrawal symptoms. It can block the euphoric effects of
              short-acting opioids, such as heroin.
            </p>
            <p>
              Methadone is usually taken daily as a drinkable liquid. It can be
              dispensed only at licensed, federally-regulated opioid treatment
              programs, so having reliable daily transportation to a clinic is
              important while taking methadone.
            </p>
            <p>
              Because methadone controls withdrawal symptoms and blocks
              cravings, people who are addicted to opioids tend to stick with
              it. This allows them to build a life in recovery and avoid the
              hazards and problems that come with illegal drug use. People who
              take methadone for a year or more have the best rates of success.
            </p>
            <p>
              Methadone can work for people who have made other unsuccessful
              attempts to stop using opioids or alcohol. It is a recommended
              treatment for opioid use disorder during pregnancy.
            </p>
            <h3>
              <strong>Buprenorphine</strong>
            </h3>
            <h4>
              <em>(byoo-preh-NOR-feen)</em>
            </h4>
            <p>
              Buprenorphine works in a similar way to methadone, controlling
              withdrawal symptoms and blocking cravings. Buprenorphine is
              usually taken daily as a small film that must be dissolved under
              the tongue.
            </p>
            <p>
              Most guidelines suggest people with shorter, less extensive
              histories of heavy opioid use may be good candidates for treatment
              with buprenorphine. It also works for more severe opioid use
              disorder and for people who decide to switch from methadone.
            </p>
            <p>
              Buprenorphine can be a good choice for people who can’t regularly
              get to an opioid treatment program. Doctors who have completed a
              required training and certification process can prescribe
              buprenorphine for patients they see in the office. While the
              beginning of treatment usually involves frequent in-office visits,
              patients may be able to have a prescription to take at home.
            </p>
            <p>
              Buprenorphine is widely available in a formula that contains added
              naloxone (commonly known as Narcan), which discourages abusing or
              injecting it.
            </p>
            <h3>
              <strong>Naltrexone</strong>
            </h3>
            <h4>
              <em>(nal-TREX-ohn)</em>
            </h4>
            <p>
              Naltrexone blocks the ability of opioids to eliminate pain and
              induce euphoria. This removes the rewarding aspects of opioid use
              that result in a desire for more. It is available in an extended
              release injection that is given every 30 days and in tablet form,
              taken once a day by mouth.
            </p>
            <p>
              Because of the way naltrexone blocks opioid receptors in the
              brain, it’s not a good fit for everyone. Before starting
              naltrexone, you needs to get through an initial 7-10 days of
              withdrawal. People with chronic pain problems, who sometimes need
              to take opioid medications, should work carefully with their
              doctor about a pain management strategy before starting
              naltrexone.
            </p>
            <p>
              Naltrexone works well for highly motivated people who are able to
              stop opioid use for 7-10 days prior to beginning treatment. It is
              a good option for those who are eager to eliminate all opioids.
              The injectable form is helpful for people who have a hard time
              keeping up with daily pills.
            </p>
            <p>
              Since it is approved for treating alcohol problems as well, people
              taking naltrexone may find it also helps them avoid drinking.

              <strong>Does insurance cover substance use treatment?</strong>
            </h3>
            <p>
              The Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act (MHPAEA) of 2008
              requires health insurers and group health plans to provide the
              <strong> same level of benefits</strong> for mental and/or
              substance use treatment and services that they do for medical and
              surgical care. That means your insurance company can’t tell you
              “we don’t do substance abuse treatment” or “mental health isn’t
              covered” — if they do, they’re breaking the law.

              is and how much you’ve already paid towards it for the year. Any

              costs down the line, because your insurance will be more willing
              to cover the services you receive.
            </p>
            <p>
              Just as with other kinds of medical care, you may have a
              <strong> co-pay</strong> — a small amount of money you need to pay
              upfront to the providers or facilities you visit. Find out how
              much that is, as well as how many appointments or days of
              treatment are covered per year.
            </p>
            <p>
              You can also ask your insurer if they have
              <strong> case managers</strong>. A case manager is a registered
              nurse, social worker, or other licensed healthcare provider who
              can work with you directly. Their services are usually covered by
              the cost you’re already paying to your insurance. They’ll help you

                <li>
                  Do it during an <strong> open enrollment period</strong>. For
                  a limited period of time each year, federal- and state-run
                  insurance exchanges allow anyone to sign up for or change
                  their plans. In most states, enrollment for 2020 will be{' '}
                  <strong> November 1 - December 15, 2019</strong>.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Have a <strong> qualifying life event </strong>
                  For 60 days after a major change in your life — like having a
                  baby, getting married or divorced, or getting U.S. citizenship
                  — you’re eligible to sign up for new insurance.

                <li>
                  Are <strong> eligible for Medicaid</strong>. In most states,
                  if you make less than $17,236 as an individual or $29,435 in a
                  family of three, you’re eligible for free or low-cost health
                  coverage. You can apply for Medicaid at any time —
                  <strong> there’s no enrollment period</strong> — so contact
                  your state agency for more details if you think you might be
                  eligible.

              Some individual treatment facilities offer{' '}
              <strong> grants or scholarships</strong> to help offset the cost
              of attending. Not all of these will cover your whole stay, though,
              and many will revoke funding if you don’t complete their program —
              leaving you financially responsible for the time you spent there.
              Before accepting any grants or scholarships, make sure you ask
              questions about what (if any) strings are attached to that money.
